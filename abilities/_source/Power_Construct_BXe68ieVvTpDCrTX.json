Any other creatures within the Blast are then pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside of the Blast. The user then changes to Complete Forme until the end of the Scene, increasing its space to fill the Blast if it was placed, and gains Temporary Hit Points equal to half of the maximum hit points that Complete Forme would have. If the user would not be able to fit in the space around it at the end of this Ability, this Ability may not be used. Innate.\nThe user still uses the HP total and HP Maximum of the Forme that it was in (10% of 50% Forme) before entering Complete Forme. Both Formes must still follow BSR.",

    "effect": "This Pokémon has two modes, Night and Day. In Night mode, the user’s default Special Attack CS is +1, and it gains a +2 bonus to Athletics and Acrobatics. In Day mode, the user’s default Defense CS is +1, and it gains a +3 bonus to Stealth. Switching modes is a Standard Action. Upon a change in modes, the old increased stat immediately loses 2 CS, and the new increased stat immediately gains 2 CS, representing a change in defaults. This ability may not be copied or swapped.",

    "effect": "Target: A Glyph you have put down, regardless of distance\nEffect: The target Glyph becomes an Unown of your Trainer Level, its Stats allocated as you wish. This Unown knows a single instance of Hidden Power, identical to your own. The Glyph can fight on its own without needing you to command it. At the end of the encounter, or after 5 minutes, the Unown returns to Unown Space forever, destroying the Glyph. You may only have one Glyph active in this way at a time; if various Alarm Glyphs are triggered to become Sentries at the same time, only one does so; the others will do so once the previous one has been destroyed if the Trigger condition is still being met.",

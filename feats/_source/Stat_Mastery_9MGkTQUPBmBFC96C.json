This does not affect the size of Area-Of-Effect moves (But does affect the range at which you can place Ranged Blasts).\nSpecial Defense Effect: Whenever your Pokémon would lose a Tick of Hit Points from Status Afflictions, Weather, or other effects, they lose 5 fewer Hit Points, to a minimum of 1.\nSpeed Effect: Your Pokémon may take Disengage Maneuvers as Swift Actions.",

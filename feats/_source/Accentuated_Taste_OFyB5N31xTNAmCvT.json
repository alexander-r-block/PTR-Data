    "effect": "Whenever you create a Snack with a Chef Feature, you may assign it a Taste chosen from Salty, Sour, Spicy, Dry, and Sweet. Tasty Snacks must be assigned their corresponding Taste. Whenever a Pokémon trades in a Food Buff from a Snack with an assigned Taste they do not dislike, they gain one of the following bonuses based on the assigned Taste:\n\n»» Salty: The user gains 5 Temporary Hit Points. This stacks with any Temporary Hit Points gained through Chef Features, the Lunchbox Ability, and the Food Buff.\n\n»» Spicy: Increase the user’s Critical Hit Range by 1.\n\n»» Sour: Increase the user’s Evasion against damaging attacks by 1.\n\n»» Dry: Increase the user’s Effect Range of all attacks by 1.\n\n»» Bitter: The user gets a +1 Bonus to all Save Checks.\n\n»» Sweet: Increase the user’s Initiative by 5.\n\nThis bonus can only be gained once per item, even if Complex Aftertaste is used to give an additional Food Buff for the item.\n\nRecipe - Preserves",

Chic Pokémon gain two extra Held Item slots with which they can carry Held Items. However, the items in these slots have no effect and are not treated as equipped. As a Swift Action on their turn, Chic Pokémon may swap a currently active Held Item with an item stored in these slots. Chic Pokémon may not carry multiple items of the same type or with repeated effects.\n A Chic Pokémon does not become Suppressed until they switch a Choice Item into their active Held Item slot, but even if they then switch the Choice Item out, they remain Suppressed for the remainder of combat. A Mega-Evolved Chic Pokémon remains MegaEvolved even if they switch their active Held Item.",

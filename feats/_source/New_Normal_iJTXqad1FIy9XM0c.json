New Normal may only be used once per Scene per Pokémon. New Normal may not raise a Move’s Damage Base above 14; if a Move would have its Damage Base raised above that value, it is instead raised to 14. (Examples: Return is DB 9, Wring Out never has its damage decreased due to the target’s Hit Points, Retaliate is DB 14.)",

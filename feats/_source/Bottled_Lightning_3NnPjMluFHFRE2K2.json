Bottled Lightning counts as using the Move for frequency purposes. You may expend this Charge as a Swift Action on your turn to use the Move the item was charged with, originating from the item. If a Pok√©mon or Trainer touches a Charged item, you may instead activate this Swift Action as if it had the Priority keyword. At the end of a Scene, all items lose their Charge, and you may only have X items Charged at a time where X is half your Focus Rank.",

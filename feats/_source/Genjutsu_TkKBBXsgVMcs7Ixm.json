    "effect": "You form an Illusion around yourself. This Illusion may be used to hide yourself in a shroud of darkness if in darkness, or to make yourself look like a mundane object (such as a crate, potted plant, or similar). The Illusion can even fool Aura, concealing you from Aura Sight for its duration. However, the Illusion requires complete concentration, and is broken if you take any actions at all. Anyone that interacts with the Illusion directly may make an Occult Education or Intuition Check with a DC equal to 10 plus your Stealth Rank; if they succeed, the Illusion is broken.",

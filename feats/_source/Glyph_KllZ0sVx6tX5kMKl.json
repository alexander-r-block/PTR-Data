Glyphs have HP equal to your Level, and no other stats. Glyphs last until they are destroyed or intentionally de-activated, at which time the Unown returns to Unown Space, disappearing forever. You may have a number of active Glyphs equal to your Occult Education Rank. When setting a Glyph, you may have the Glyphs be either visible or invisible, as you prefer. At any time, as a Standard Action, you may Channel any Glyph you have set down. This causes the Glyphâ€™s eye to open and become visible if it was not. While you are channeling a Glyph, you are able to see through the Glyph, listen through it, and project your voice through it.",

Before damage resolves, your Pokémon may use a 1-Target damaging attack on the foe making the triggering attack as an Interrupt, Frequency allowing, and also automatically hits as a Critical Hit. Damage for both attacks then resolve at the same time.\nThis effect bypasses immunity to Critical Hits on your own Pokémon, but not on the target. Though both attacks hit automatically and are Critical Hits, you may still roll to activate effects.",

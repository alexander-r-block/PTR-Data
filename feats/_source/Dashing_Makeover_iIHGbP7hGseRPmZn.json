While this Feature is Bound, the target gains the effects of the chosen item, as long as they would normally be able to equip it (e.g.: Trainers cannot equip Incense Items).They do not need to take up an Equipment or Held Item slot to gain this benefit. A target may only be affected by one instance of Dashing Makeover at a time.\nRecipe - Practical Fashion",

Anyone who begins or ends their turn on a Fire Hazard are Burned. Anyone that passes through a Fire Hazard loses a Tick of Hit Points. If a Ground, Rock, or Water-Type Move targets a square (or a target in a square) with Fire Hazard in them, the Fire Hazards are destroyed. All effects that destroy Hazards extinguish Fire Hazards.

Your Pokémon may immediately make an attack as an Interrupt, but this attack must target only a Tagged Foe. If the attack misses, it still deals damage as if it had the Smite keyword. If the attack hits, it’s automatically a Critical Hit. If it would have already been a Critical Hit, your Pokémon gains Hit Points equal to half of its maximum Hit Points. May be used only once per Scene per Pokémon .",

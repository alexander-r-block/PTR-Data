This Check is made each time a Trainer attempts to use an activated Gift, and a failure means neither any resources such as AP nor the frequency of the Gift is expended. For Gifts with Static or ongoing effects, the Check is made each turn, and a failure ends the effect for that turn. Giftsapper’s user may never gain Gifts.",
